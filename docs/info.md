## How it works

This project uses a 4x4 Array Multiplier to multiplies two four-bit numbers together, using a series of full adders to result in an 8 bit product. The multiplier works by systematically multiplying each bit of the first number with each bit of the second number. These partial products are then combined using a series of full adders to form the final result.

## How to test

See if outcome is correct from the two four-bit numbers by manually checking.
